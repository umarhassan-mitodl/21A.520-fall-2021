#### Course Meeting Times

Seminars: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

#### Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for this course.

#### Course Description

This course explores magic, science, and religion as systems of explaining and controlling events. How do these belief systems develop, evolve, and function in the practice of everyday life? While magic, science, and religion may seem like stable domains, we examine how the meaning of these categories shifts over time and across contexts, so much so that the difference between them often seems to break down altogether. By focusing on cross-cultural differences in systems of belief, we raise fundamental questions about human nature itself, and the basic human need to interpret and influence events. Students will explore key debates in social scientific (particularly anthropological) research on magic, science, and religion, and conduct their own original research projects involving first-hand observations of magical, scientific, and religious practices.

#### Code of Conduct

Anthropology is a social science governed by a professional Code of Ethics. It enjoins all researchers to respect the dignity of the human beings who are the subjects of their research. In this class, we will encounter diverse systems of belief, some of which we will inevitably disagree with. As students of anthropology, it is important that we use empathy as a resource for understanding the reasons why people maintain beliefs different form our own. It is also a requirement for this class that we extend this same principle to each other as seminar participants with sometimes differing viewpoints.

#### Required Reading

Students are expected to read two research articles or book chapters a week and come to the first seminar of the week prepared to discuss them. Research articles average around 12 pages of small-font text (plus citations, figures…). Book chapters average around 24 pages of large-font text (plus citations, figures…). All required readings are available in the {{% resource_link "4c1b8511-82a5-46ae-8ab2-cca0ac0322b9" "Readings" %}} section.
